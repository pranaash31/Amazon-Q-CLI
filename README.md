# 🎮 CyberMind – The Codebreaker Challenge 🔐

**CyberMind** is a sleek, logic-based codebreaking game built with **Python**, inspired by classic Mastermind puzzles — but with a cyberpunk aesthetic and a smart, minimal design. Players must crack a 4-digit code within 10 attempts using color-coded feedback for each guess.

This project was proudly built using **Amazon Q CLI**, leveraging AI-assisted development to speed up coding, debugging, and design.
